# VBA-OMM
Identification of the Oral Minimal Model of glucose dynamcis using Variational Bayesian Analysis.

# MATLAB
To use the MATLAB version of the toolbox simiply download all files and subfolders in folder MATLAB and add them to your path. The main function is called VBA_OMM_G.m and contains a detailed description on how to use it. To see how the function is used and its inputs are defined, you can run the respective script in the \demo folder. A detailed description of the underlying methodology is found in the publication below. The core of the VBA approach in MATLAB is copied from the following wesite http://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/.

# Python 
To use the Python version of the toolbox simiply download all files and subfolders in folder Python. The main function is called VBA_OMM_G.py and contains a detailed description on how to use it. To see how the function is used and its inputs are defined, you can run the respective script in the \demo folder. A detailed description of the underlying methodology is found in the publication below.
